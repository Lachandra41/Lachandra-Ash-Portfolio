Adult Income Prediction with Machine Learning

The adult income prediction project goal is to predict the income of adults that reside in multiple countries. The income is greater than, equal to, or less than $50K per year. I used Naive Bayes model to predict accuracy of the adult income. Python porgramming language was used to analyza the data. 

Bank Loans Marketing with Machine Learning

The bank loans marketing campaign project is about campaigns that a bank from portugal used to draw their subscribed consumers to their other loan services. The loan services include personal loans, housing loans, and term deposits. The banks obtain money from the intrest rates of the loans and term deposits. I used Naive Bayes to predict the if consumers will or will not subscribe to another loan or term deposit. Python porgramming language was used to analyza the data. 

Big Mart Sales Prediction with Machine Learning

The big mart sales prediction project is about data scientists who compiled sales informatin for the  big mart outlets and ten various locationsl.The goal was to create a predictive model that can be utilized to estimate how well an item will sell at each store. I used the gradient booster regressor model to predict the item outlet sales of each outlet. I used python programming language to analyze the data within the dataset.

FedEx and Machine Learning

The FedEx shipment prediction project is about Fedex wanting to increase their revenue by keeping a revolving consumer  base. FedEx does not want their consumers to be upset and leave their services if their shipments are delayed or do not show up. Python programming language was used to analyze the data for useful insights that will help them increase their profits. I used the naive bayes model. 

Pizza Restaurant Sales with Exploratory Data Analysis

The pizza restaurant wanted to sale as many pizzas as they can to increase their profits. The pizza resturant needed the type of pizzas, number of pizzas, pizza sales, size of pizzas, unit price per slice of pizza, and quantity of pizzas to be analyzed. The python programming language was used to analyze the data. 

Walmart Coffee Listings Exploratory Data Analysis

The walmart coffee listings project featured the walmart brand and sponsored brands of coffee. Walmart's goals are to increase their sales, number of consumers, increase the coffee ratings, and increase the coffee reviews. Walmart believes that more consumers will purchases the coffees from their website based on other consumer ratings and reviews. I used python programming language to analyze the data.

Walmart Sales Prediction

Walmart wanted their sales to be predicted for the holiday weeks versus the non-holiday weeks. Walmart wants to increase their revenue from their products that are sold to their consumers on a daily basis. the three models used for the project were decision tree classifier, logistic regression, and support vector machine. Python programming language was used to analyze the walmart sales data.
